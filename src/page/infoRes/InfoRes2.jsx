            One more spot of the restaurant that is totally worth attention is
            the farthest wall covered with glass slabs of copper shade. Some of
            the slabs have unique floristic patterns of imprinted local herbs.
            No pattern repeats. Two thousand glass slabs are installed on the
            dynamic constructions so you can move each of them up and down and
            lock on different angles. It allows everyone to create different
            patterns on the wall and involves visitors interacting with the
            space. The wall with its adjustive image is our metaphor of reeds
            moved by the wind.
